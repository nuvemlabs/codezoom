# Task 001: Project Initialization - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Initialize the CodeZoom VS Code extension project with proper foundation, build system, and development workflow.

## Scope
- Git repository setup with remote connection
- Complete directory structure per CLAUDE.md specification  
- NPM project configuration with VS Code extension metadata
- Development dependencies installation (TypeScript, webpack, testing)
- Build system configuration (webpack, TypeScript, ESLint)
- Basic extension scaffold with command registration
- Development workflow setup (Makefile, scripts)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Repository Initialization
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create GitHub repository nuvemlabs/codezoom
- [x] Set up remote connection and push initial state

### 2. Directory Structure
- [x] Create src/ subdirectories: commands, core, llm, parsers, ui, utils
- [x] Create test/ subdirectories: unit, e2e
- [x] Create project/tasks directory for task planning
- [x] Create docs directory for documentation

### 3. NPM Project Setup
- [x] Initialize package.json with npm init
- [x] Configure VS Code extension metadata
- [x] Add command contributions and keybindings
- [x] Set activation events for supported languages

### 4. Dependencies Installation
- [x] VS Code extension deps: @types/vscode, @vscode/test-electron, webpack
- [x] TypeScript compilation: typescript, ts-loader
- [x] Testing framework: mocha, chai, sinon with type definitions
- [x] Production deps: axios, dotenv
- [x] Code quality: eslint with TypeScript support

### 5. Build System Configuration
- [x] TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- [x] Webpack configuration for extension bundling
- [x] ESLint configuration for code quality
- [x] Package.json scripts for build, test, watch

### 6. Development Workflow
- [x] Comprehensive Makefile with all development targets
- [x] Basic extension.ts with command registration scaffold
- [x] Sample unit test structure
- [x] Project gitignore configuration

### 7. Initial Testing
- [x] Verify build system works (webpack compilation)
- [x] Create basic extension activation test
- [x] Confirm VS Code extension structure is valid

## Success Criteria
- [x] Repository accessible at https://github.com/nuvemlabs/codezoom
- [x] `make build` compiles successfully
- [x] Extension structure follows VS Code extension guidelines
- [x] All specified directories created per architecture
- [x] Development workflow functional

## Technical Decisions
- **Build System**: Webpack for bundling (standard for VS Code extensions)
- **Testing**: Mocha + Chai + Sinon (comprehensive testing stack)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with TypeScript plugin
- **Development**: Makefile-driven workflow for consistency

## Dependencies
- None (initial task)

## Risk Mitigation
- Used established VS Code extension patterns
- Followed official extension development guidelines
- Set up comprehensive testing from start
